#  Shutdown looms for popular Wekopa casino

Just months after it opened its doors, the popular Wekopa casino resort in Arizona is facing closure, as its owner threatens to shut it down amid financial difficulties.

The casino resort, which is located close to the Apache Junction and Fountain Hills areas of the state, is reported to have been struggling financially since it opened earlier this year. And now its owner, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, says that it may have no choice but to close the casino resort if things don’t improve soon.

In a statement released last week, the tribe said that it was exploring all possible options for the future of Wekopa, including closure. It added that while there were still discussions ongoing with potential investors and partners, no deal had yet been reached.

If Wekopa does close, it will be another blow for the embattled Native American gaming industry. The industry has been battling against a number of negative headwinds in recent years, including increasing competition from commercial casinos and a downturn in tourism spending.

#  State of emergency declared at Wekopa casino 

Casino management has announced that the Wekopa casino will be in a state of emergency starting from 9am on Monday. This follows an incident over the weekend where a patron became irate and began causing a disturbance.

According to casino security, the patron was asked to leave after becoming disruptive but refused to do so. He then began throwing objects around the casino and threatened staff and other guests. Management decided to place the casino in a state of emergency until the situation could be brought under control.

The casino is now closed and all guests have been asked to leave. The patron in question is still at large and is considered to be dangerous. Management urges anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact police immediately.

#  Casino standoff ends with gunshot victim

Just after 2 a.m. Saturday, an armed security guard at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas confronted an alleged armed robber, resulting in a standoff that ended with the guard shooting the suspect.

The security guard, who has not been identified, told police that he saw the suspect with a gun inside the casino and followed him into an area near the poker room. The guard said that when he attempted to take the suspect into custody, the man turned and pointed his gun at him.

In fear for his life, the guard fired his own weapon twice, striking the suspect in the torso. The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries.

Casino surveillance footage captured the entire incident and is currently being reviewed by police as part of their ongoing investigation.

#  Police: Argument preceded casino shooting

# Suspect says robbery victim 'disrespected' him

LAS VEGAS - A police official says an argument preceded the shooting and killing of a man at a Las Vegas casino.

Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Friday that the assailant and the victim were playing poker at the time of the shooting. He says the suspect told investigators that the victim disrespected him, and that's why he shot him.

McMahill also said that video footage from the shooting shows the victim was shot several times. The gunman then fled on foot.

The identity of both men has not been released.

#  Authorities investigating deadly casino shooting

A shooting at a casino in the Philippines has killed at least 36 people and injured dozens more. Officials say the gunman stormed into the casino, firing shots and setting gaming tables on fire. The motive for the attack is still under investigation.

This latest mass shooting is just the latest in a long line of such atrocities across the globe. In December 2017, a gunman killed 26 people in a church in Texas; in October, a man killed 58 people in Las Vegas; and in June 2016, a gunman killed 49 people at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.

So why do these shootings keep happening? There is no one answer to that question, but there are several possible factors at work. One is that America’s gun culture helps to enable such shootings. America has far more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and there is little regulation of firearms. This means that shooters can easily obtain firearms and ammunition, which can lead to more deadly outcomes.

Another possible factor is the way that America handles mental health issues. Compared to other developed countries, America has far fewer mental health resources available, and those who do suffer from mental health problems are often not adequately treated. This can lead to them feeling isolated and disenfranchised from society, which can make them more susceptible to committing acts of violence.

Finally, America’s income inequality may be playing a role as well. In recent years, the gap between the richest and poorest Americans has widened dramatically, and many people feel like they have no hope for the future. This can lead to feelings of anger and frustration that may sometimes erupt into violence.

Until America addresses these underlying issues, we can expect to see more mass shootings like this one in the Philippines.
