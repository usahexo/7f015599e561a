#  Sands sells Bethlehem casino to OK368 for $1B

# The Sands Bethlehem casino has been sold to OK368 for $1B, according to a statement from the casino.

# "The Sands Bethlehem is an iconic property and we are proud to add it to our growing portfolio," said OK368 CEO Alex Cheng in a statement. "We are committed to continuing its legacy as one of the top casinos in the region."

# The deal will reportedly close in the fourth quarter of 2019.

# The Sands Bethlehem Casino first opened its doors in 2009 and has been a major attraction in the Lehigh Valley ever since. It features 2,000 slot machines, 144 table games, and a 14-story luxury hotel.

# "This is good news for the Lehigh Valley and for Pennsylvania's gaming industry," said PA Gaming Control Board Chairman Kevin O'Toole in a statement. "The sale of this well-performing casino assures that it will continue to be a strong contributor to the state's gaming revenues."

#  Sands selling Bethlehem casino to OK368

The Sands Corporation, the Las Vegas-based casino giant, has agreed to sell its Bethlehem casino to OK368 Holdings Ltd., a company controlled by the massive Chinese gambling and entertainment conglomerate, for $1.3 billion.

The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, would mark the first time a major U.S. casino has been sold to a Chinese company. It would also give OK368 a coveted East Coast presence, as it seeks to compete with established gaming companies like MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Limited.

"The Sands Bethlehem asset is a perfect fit with our existing portfolio and provides us with an important presence in the high-growth East Coast market," said Charles Ho, CEO of OK368, in a statement.

For Sands, the sale marks an opportunity to redeploy its resources towards other properties in its portfolio. "This transaction maximizes the value of our Bethlehem property and allows us to further focus on our domestic growth initiatives," said Michael Leven, CEO of Sands Corp., in a statement.

The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.

#  Why did Sands sell Bethlehem online casino?

The news that land casino business Sands Corp has struck a deal to sell its Bethlehem online casino to MGM Resorts International for $2.4 billion came as a surprise to many industry observers.

It is not unusual for a land casino operator to seek an exit from the online gambling market, given the higher capital costs and regulatory risks associated with the industry. However, the fact that Sands has chosen to divest its Bethlehem operation – rather than its more profitable Las Vegas properties – has puzzled many industry insiders.

So why did Sands sell Bethlehem online casino?

There are a number of possible explanations for this move. One possibility is that Sands is looking to focus on its core business in Macau, where it enjoys a dominant market position. The company may also believe that the MGM Resorts can better exploit the Bethlehem online casino operation, given its greater scale and resources.

It is also possible that Sands is feeling pressure from US regulators amid increasing scrutiny of the online gambling industry. The company may have decided that it is prudent to sell Bethlehem online casino now, while demand for such assets remains strong.

Whatever the reason for the sale, it is clear that it represents a significant development in the rapidly evolving US online gambling market.

#  What does OK368 plan to do with the Bethlehem casino?

According to the Sands Bethlehem website, the casino is "the #1 tourist destination in Pennsylvania." That being said, it's no wonder that OK368 has its eye on the casino as a potential business venture.

What does OK368 plan to do with the Bethlehem casino?

There are a few things that could happen. First, OK368 could simply buy the casino from its current owners. This would give OK368 complete control over the casino and its operations. Second, OK368 could partner with the current owners of the casino. This would give OK368 a stake in the casino while still allowing the current owners to maintain control over it. Finally, OK368 could attempt to purchase a share of the casino from its current owners. This would give OK368 a smaller stake in the casino while still allowing it some control over its operations.

#  Casino sale could signal shift in Sands' priorities

The recent sale of Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem could signal a shift in the company's priorities, according to some industry experts.

The $1.3 billion deal, which was announced earlier this month, is the largest casino sale in Pennsylvania history. It's also the second-largest U.S. casino sale ever, behind only the $2.4 billion sale of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in 2014.

So why did Sands decide to sell? There are a few possible explanations.

For one, Sands may be looking to focus on its newer properties in China and Singapore. The company opened its first property in Macau in 2004 and has been expanding rapidly in recent years. In Singapore, Sands opened its first property in 2012 and now has four casinos there.

Another possibility is that Sands is feeling pressure from regulators in both China and the U.S. In China, gambling is outlawed except for a small number of tightly controlled casinos; as such, Sands has come under scrutiny from Chinese authorities in recent years. And in the U.S., Sands has faced criticism for its involvement in setting up online gambling operations that violate federal law.

Whatever the reason for the sale, it's clear that Sands is no longer interested in expanding its casino business in the U.S. This could have a major impact on the casino industry as a whole, as Sands has been one of the most aggressive players in recent years.

So what does this mean for other casinos? Well, it's likely that they'll need to start focusing more on domestic growth instead of relying on expansions overseas. This could lead to more competition among casinos as they battle for market share within the U.S.
