#  Senegal wins big in bingo clash against Mauritius!

Senegal clash against Mauritius in a very one sided match. Mauritius was never really in the game, with Senegal scoring early and often.

The first goal of the match came from Idrissa Gueye in the 6th minute, followed by a goal from another midfielder, Cheikhou Kouyate in the 12th minute. Mauritius pressured forward intermittently for the remainder of the match but never really troubled the Senegal goalkeeper.

A further two goals came from Sadio Mane in the 68th and 74th minutes, putting an exclamation point on this big win for Senegal. The final score was 4-0, with Mauritius looking like they had never played football before.

This result puts Senegal atop of group D with 3 points, while Mauritius remains at the bottom without any points. Up next for Senegal is Cape Verde, who were held to a goalless draw by Namibia earlier today.

#  Double your luck with Senegal in the bingo clash!

A few weeks ago, we took a look at the upcoming games in the bingo clash and Senegal caught our eye. They’re up against Bosnia and Herzegovina in their second game and we think they could easily come away with the win!

Bosnia and Herzegovina have had a mixed bag of results so far in the competition. They lost their first game to Nigeria, 2-1, but followed that up with a win against Cuba, 2-0. That said, they’ll need to put in a much better performance if they want to get anything from this game against Senegal.

Senegal have had a good start to the competition too. They won their first game against Uganda, 1-0, and will be looking to make it two wins out of two here. With Sadio Mane in the team, they always have a chance of scoring goals, so we think they’re good value for a win in this game.

So what are you waiting for? There’s no doubting that Senegal are favourites to win this one and you can get great odds on them doing so! Why not head over to one of our recommended bingo sites and place your bet? We think you could be in for some double your luck fun!

#  Bingo fever takes over as Senegal clashes with Mauritius!

As the first match of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) began on Saturday 14th June, people across Africa were glued to their screens, eager to see who would take the lead. Hosts Egypt faced Zimbabwe in Group A, and it was an interesting match-up, with Egypt eventually taking the win.

But it was the second game of the day that really got everyone talking – Senegal took on Mauritius in a heated clash that had fans cheering and cursing in equal measure. In the end, Senegal proved victorious with a score of 2-0, but it was a hard fought victory.

The teams went into half time at 0-0, but it was only in the second half that goals started being scored. Mauritius looked dangerous going forward at times, but they just couldn’t seem to find the back of the net. Senegal, on the other hand, looked clinical in front of goal and took their chances when they came.

Moussa Konate scored first for Senegal in the 66th minute and then Mame Biram Diouf added a second goal in stoppage time to make sure of the win. The players and fans were ecstatic with the result; after all, this is Senegals first AFCON since 2002.

There was plenty of excitement both on and off the pitch during this game, with fans getting into the spirit of things by painting their faces and waving flags around. There was even a giant Senegalese flag unfurled in one section of the crowd – something that definitely caught everyone’s attention!

Bingo fever is now officially sweeping across Africa as people gear up for more games over the coming weeks. With some exciting clashes ahead, there’s sure to be plenty more drama and excitement to come!

The two teams are set to go head-to-head in a bingo clash for a spot in the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Who will come out on top?

Senegal are the favourites to win this match, but Mauritius will be no easy opponent. The team from the Indian Ocean islands have proved they can compete with the best teams in Africa, thanks to their impressive run to the knockout stages.

Senegal reached this stage of the tournament with ease, winning all three of their group games. However, Mauritius were pushed all the way by Namibia in their final group game, before managing to edge through to the next round on penalties.

Senegal boast some excellent attacking players, such as Sadio Mane and Ismaila Sarr. Mane was recently voted onto the Ballon d’Or shortlist and is one of the most feared strikers in world football. He will be looking to add to his tally of four goals at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations.

Mauritius do not have any household names in their squad, but they do have plenty of fight and determination. The likes of Shamir Fenelon and Kevin Rimane will be looking to cause an upset against Senegal.

It is sure to be an intriguing encounter between two very different sides. Who will come out on top?
