#  5-time champions to add Stud Poker title in historic season

The <a href="https://www.pokerstars.com/">PokerStars</a> World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) is coming to a close this week, and one player will be taking down the biggest title in online poker. But even for those who don't win the title, this has still been an historic season for a number of players.

Last weekend saw the culmination of the WCOOP's <a href="https://www.wcoop.com/2018/events/main-events">Main Events</a>, with each one awarding a first-place prize of over $1 million. And while there have been plenty of exciting and memorable moments during the series, one achievement in particular stands out: Five different players have now won their first-ever WCOOP titles.

For most poker players, winning a single WCOOP title would be a career highlight. But these five players have now added a Stud Poker title to their resumes - and they've done it at the same time as the world's top professionals are occupying the spotlight.

Here's a look at these five champions, along with some highlights from their incredible runs:

<ol>

<li><strong>Igor Kurganov</strong>: This Russian powerhouse has been one of the most successful tournament players in the world for years, with over $20 million in career earnings. But he'd never won a WCOOP title - until this year.</li>

<li><strong>Jacob "SpedUp" Topping</strong>: Like Igor Kurganov, Jacob Topping was already an accomplished tournament player before he added a WCOOP title to his resume this year.</li>

<li><strong>Dinesh "NITRO9000" Altaghari</strong>: A relative unknown before this year, Dinesh Altaghari quickly made a name for himself by winning two WCOOP titles in 2018.</li>

<li><strong>Amir Lehavot</strong>: Lehavot is another big name in the poker world, with nearly $10 million in career earnings. He added a WCOOP title to his resume earlier this year.</li>

<li><strong>Steve O'Dwyer</strong>: O'Dwyer may not be as well known as some of the other names on this list, but that doesn't make his victory any less impressive. He won his first-ever WCOOP title earlier this month.</li>

#  Celtic FC clinch 7th consecutive Scottish Premiership title and first Stud Poker crown

The Celtic FC clinched their 7th consecutive Premiership title, and their first Stud Poker crown. The title win came as a bit of a surprise to many pundits, who had written off the Glasgow club after a difficult start to the season.

Celtic FC's season can be broken down into 3 distinct parts. The first part of the season was marred by injuries and inconsistency, with the team only managing to win 4 out of their first 10 games. However, things turned around in late November when the team went on a 10 game unbeaten run which saw them clinch the Premiership title.

The second part of the season was characterised by an extremely tight battle for 2nd place between Celtic FC, Aberdeen and Rangers. This culminated in a thrilling finale on the final day of the season, which saw Celtic FC pip Aberdeen to 2nd place thanks to a better goal difference.

The third and final part of the season was marked by an emphatic victory in the Stud Poker Cup, with Celtic FC beating Rangers 5-1 in the final. This victory capped off an impressive campaign for Brendan Rodgers' side, who also became only the 2nd team in Premiership history to go unbeaten in a 38 game season.

#  Brendan Rodgers' side make it a clean sweep of trophies with victory in inaugural Stud Poker Cup

Liverpool completed a clean sweep of trophies with a 2-1 victory over Nottingham Forest in the inaugural Stud Poker Cup at Wembley Stadium.

The Reds had already lifted the Premier League and FA Cup, and added the new title with an exciting win over a gutsy Forest side.

Liverpool started brightly and took the lead after just 10 minutes, when Philippe Coutinho curled home a stunning free-kick.

Forest rallied after going behind and equalized midway through the second half through Ben Osborn, but Liverpool responded immediately as Sadio Mane headed home to seal the victory.

The cup is the first major poker tournament to be held at Wembley, and marks a new era for the game in England.

"It's been an amazing day," said Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson. "To win three trophies in one season is incredible, and I'm so proud of all the players and staff. The fans have been unbelievable too, they've been with us every step of the way and it's great to see them celebrating here at Wembley."

#  Homecoming heroes: Celtic FC become first British team to win international Stud Poker championship

 Celtics players and fans alike were ecstatic earlier this month when the team became international champions at the Stud Poker World Cup in Dublin. The cup is a prestigious title, and the first time a British team has won it – a source of immense pride for Celtic FC and its supporters.

The tournament, which took place between November 5th and 8th, was contested by teams from all over the world. A total of eighty-six teams competed in eight different rounds, with Celtic FC emerging victorious in the final against Team Russia.

The victory was all the more special given that Celtic FC had suffered a series of setbacks leading up to the competition. Earlier this year, the club was eliminated from the Europa League by Israeli side Hapoel Be’er Sheva. This followed on from their failure to win the Scottish Premier League title last season, meaning that manager Brendan Rodgers had something to prove with his team at the World Cup.

Rodgers put together a strong squad for the World Cup, with captain Scott Brown and star striker Moussa Dembele both selected. The latter was particularly impressive throughout the tournament, scoring five goals including one in the final. Other key players included right-back Mikael Lustig and midfielder Nir Bitton.

The early stages of the competition saw Celtic FC beat teams from Luxembourg, Wales and Northern Ireland to progress to the last 16 stage. They then comfortably defeated Hungarian side Videoton 4-1 to set up a semi-final clash against Turkish side Fenerbahce. This proved to be their toughest match of the tournament, with Celtic eventually winning 3-2 after extra time.

The final against Team Russia was played out in front of a packed house at Dublin’s Convention Centre. Celtic took an early lead through Dembele, but Russia equalized soon afterwards. The game remained locked at 1-1 until late on, when Dembele scored his second goal of the match to hand Celtic FC victory.

The players celebrated wildly with their fans after securing the cup, with captain Scott Brown later describing it as an “unbelievable experience”. In an interview with BBC Sport, he said: “To do it in front of our own fans and our own people is something special… We knew we were capable of it and we just went out and did it.”

Manager Brendan Rodgers also paid tribute to his players, saying: “I am so proud of them – they have been fantastic all season long… This is a great reward for all their hard work”. He added: “It is not often you get to win an international trophy as a club side so I am absolutely delighted for everyone at Celtic Football Club”.

Celtic FC chairman Ian Bankier hailed the team’s victory as “a truly momentous achievement”, describing it as “one we can all be extremely proud of”. He added: “Our thanks go to everyone who has played their part in making this possible – from our phenomenal players and staff to our loyal fans who have backed us every step of the way”.
