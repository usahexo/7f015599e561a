#  Turbotax Allows Gambling Losses!

If you gamble and happen to lose money, you might be glad to know that you can claim your losses on your taxes. The good news is that Turbotax allows gambling losses! This means that if you go to a casino and lose, you can claim that lost money when you file your taxes.

There are some restrictions, of course. You can only claim gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $1,500, you can only claim $1,000 in losses on your taxes. Additionally, you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize deductions on your return.

The IRS defines gambling as “…taking part in any games or activities whose proceeds are subject to chance.” This includes activities like slot machines, roulette, blackjack, bingo and lotteries. It also includes online gambling websites. If you make a wager on whether or not Rex Tillerson will be fired as Secretary of State, that’s gambling and the loss is deductible!

So how do you claim your gambling losses? Just report them on Schedule A along with your other itemized deductions. Be sure to include documentation like receipts or tickets from the casino. If you didn’t keep track of how much money you lost while gambling, there’s no need to worry – the IRS allows estimated deductions as well. Just make sure your estimate is reasonable and supported by evidence.

Gambling losses may seem like a bad thing, but they can actually lead to some tax savings! So next time you hit the casino (or the online poker tables), remember to keep track of your losses – they could end up saving you some money on taxes.

#  How to Claim Your Gambling Winnings on TurboTax

When you hit it big at the casino, bingo hall, or online gambling site, the IRS is going to want its share of your winnings. But don’t worry – filing a tax return to claim your gambling income and losses is easy with TurboTax.

To get started, open up TurboTax and select “Start a New Return”. Next, select “Personal Income” and then “Gambling Income and Losses”.

If you won money gambling, you will need to report the amount as income on your tax return. TurboTax will walk you through adding this income to your return. If you lost money gambling, you can deduct your losses from your income. Be sure to keep track of your losses throughout the year – you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings.

TurboTax will also help you report any expenses related to gambling, such as transportation costs to and from the casino or dealer fees. Just be sure that any expenses are reasonable and necessary for gambling purposes.

Finally, don’t forget to report any prizes or winnings from sweepstakes or lotteries. These amounts should be reported on line 21 of Form 1040 as Other Income.

With TurboTax, claiming your gambling income and losses is easy – so there’s no reason not to do it!

#  Report your gambling winnings and losses with TurboTax

Did you hit the jackpot this year? Or did your luck turn south? Whatever the outcome, it’s important to report your gambling winnings and losses to the IRS. With TurboTax, it’s easy to do.

First, you’ll need to figure out how much you won or lost. To do this, simply subtract your gambling expenses from your gambling winnings. This includes things like casino entrance fees, bets, and tips.

It’s also important to keep good records of your gambling activity. This includes receipts, credit card statements, and wagering tickets. This information can help support your tax return if it’s audited.

Reporting your gambling wins and losses is easy with TurboTax. Simply follow these simple steps, and we’ll take care of the rest.

#  TurboTax Now Offers Easy Reporting of Gambling Winnings and Losses

TurboTax, the popular tax preparation software, now offers easy reporting of gambling winnings and losses. Up until this year, the process of reporting gambling income and losses was a tedious and cumbersome process. However, with the new TurboTax features, taxpayers can easily report their winnings and losses from all forms of gambling, including casino games, horse or dog racing, or lottery wins.

In order to take advantage of the TurboTax gambling reporting features, you will need to have your W-2G form(s) for the year in question. This form is usually given to you by a casino or race track if you have won over $600 in a single year. If you have not received a W-2G form for your gambling winnings, don’t worry – you can still use TurboTax to report your gambling income and losses.

To report your gambling winnings and losses using TurboTax, simply follow these steps:

1. Launch the TurboTax software and enter your personal information.

2. Select “Personal Income” from the main menu.

3. Click on “Gambling Winnings and Losses” under the “Income” section.

4. Enter your total gambling income for the year. This includes not just your winnings, but also any money that you lost while gambling.

5. Enter any expenses that you incurred as a result of your gambling activities. This could include things like transportation costs to get to the casino or betting fees.

6. TurboTax will automatically calculate your net gambling income for the year. This is the amount of income that you actually earned from your gambling activities after deducting any related expenses.

7. Report this net income on line 21 of Form 1040 (or line 13 of Form 1040A). You will also need to report any associated taxes that were withheld from your winnings on line 62 of Form 1040 (or line 41 of Form 1040A).
