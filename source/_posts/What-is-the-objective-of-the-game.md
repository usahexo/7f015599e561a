#  How do I play?

Welcome to the Getting Started with PlayStation 4 guide! In this article, we will cover the basics of how to play your new PlayStation 4.

We’ll start by looking at the console itself. The PlayStation 4 is a sleek, black box that measures approximately 275mm x 53mm x 305mm (width x height x depth). On the front of the console, you’ll find two USB 3.0 ports and a slot-loading Blu-ray drive.

The back of the console houses an HDMI port, Ethernet port, digital optical audio port, and auxiliary port. You’ll also find the power connector on the back of the console. To turn on your PlayStation 4, plug in the power cable and press the power button on the front of the console.





To play a game on your PlayStation 4, simply insert the game disc into the console’s Blu-ray drive and follow the on-screen instructions. If you don’t have a disc game, you can download games from Sony’s PlayStation Store.

To download games from Playstation Store, open up your web browser and navigate to store.playstation.com/en-us/home/. Log in to your account or create a new one if you don’t have one already. Once you’re logged in, select “Games” from the main menu and then select “PS4 Games” from the submenu. You can then use the filters on the left side of the page to narrow down your search results by genre, price, publisher, or rating.

Once you find a game that you want to download, select it and then click on “Download Game”. The game will be added to your download queue and will automatically start downloading once it becomes available. You can check on the status of your downloads by selecting “My Downloads” from under “Games & Apps” in your home screen menu or by opening up Settings > PSN > Download List.

Your PlayStation 4 comes with a built-in 500GB hard drive, which should be more than enough storage for most gamers. However, if you need more storage space, you can always upgrade your PS4's hard drive by following these simple steps: https://support.us.playstation... Storage is not just limited to games though; you can also store movies, music, and photos on your PS4's hard drive if you like.





To take screenshots or record gameplay footage while playing a game on your PlayStation 4, press and hold down both SHARE AND OPTIONS BUTTONS for about two seconds until a prompt appears on-screen. From there, you can choose whether to take a screenshot or start recording footage. The screenshots and footage will automatically be saved to your PS4's hard drive when you stop recording or taking screenshots.
