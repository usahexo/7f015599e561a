        <h1 id="Cardinals-Looking-to-Overcome-Odds-in-Playoff-Race"><a href="#Cardinals-Looking-to-Overcome-Odds-in-Playoff-Race" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Looking to Overcome Odds in Playoff Race"></a>Cardinals Looking to Overcome Odds in Playoff Race</h1><p>For the St. Louis Cardinals, the 2017 season has been an up-and-down roller coaster ride. They have overcome many odds to be in playoff contention this late in the season.</p>
<p>Going into the All-Star break, the Cardinals were 43-45 and in fourth place in the National League Central Division. Since then, they have gone on a torrid 19-9 run to move into second place, just two games behind the division-leading Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Some of their success can be attributed to timely hitting and solid pitching. They are currently ranked fourth in the National League in batting average (.259) and eighth in ERA (3.85). Their biggest strength, however, may be their resiliency.</p>
<p>This was demonstrated earlier this month when they rallied from a seven-run deficit to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 13-12 in ten innings. That was just one of six games this season that they have won after trailing by at least four runs.</p>
<p>Veteran outfielder Carlos Beltran has been a big part of their resurgence, hitting .311 with 18 home runs and 64 RBIs since the All-Star break. First baseman Matt Carpenter has also been hot, batting .359 with eight homers and 24 RBIs over that span.</p>
<p>The Cardinals will need to continue playing at a high level if they hope to catch the Cubs and win their second consecutive NL Central Division title. With tough matchups against Chicago looming on September 11th (in Chicago) and September 22nd (in St. Louis), it won’t be easy for them to pull off that feat.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-Heading-into-Playoffs-as-Underdogs"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-Heading-into-Playoffs-as-Underdogs" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals Heading into Playoffs as Underdogs"></a>Arizona Cardinals Heading into Playoffs as Underdogs</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals will head into the playoffs as underdogs, but many believe that they have what it takes to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>Led by veteran quarterback Carson Palmer, the Cardinals have put together an impressive season, and are currently the No. 2 seed in the NFC.</p>
<p>Their biggest challenge will likely be the top-seeded Carolina Panthers, who have been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL this season.</p>
<p>If they can manage to knock off the Panthers, they would likely face either the Seattle Seahawks or Green Bay Packers in the next round.</p>
<p>Both of those teams are very dangerous, but the Cardinals certainly have a chance if they can play their best football.</p>
<p>Palmer has been outstanding this season, and he has a number of talented players at his disposal.</p>
<p>Wide receivers Larry Fitzgerald and John Brown are both capable of making big plays, and running back Chris Johnson is always a threat to break loose for big gains.</p>
<p>The Cardinals’ defense has also been strong this year, and they should be able to give Carolina a tough challenge.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cardinals are definitely a team to watch in the playoffs. They may not be considered favorites, but they definitely have what it takes to make a run deep into the postseason.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-Face-Long-Odds-in-Bid-for-Super-Bowl-Berth"><a href="#Cardinals-Face-Long-Odds-in-Bid-for-Super-Bowl-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Face Long Odds in Bid for Super Bowl Berth"></a>Cardinals Face Long Odds in Bid for Super Bowl Berth</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals find themselves in a familiar position ahead of the upcoming NFL playoffs. Heading into the postseason as underdogs, they’ll look to buck the odds and make a run to Super Bowl LIII.</p>
<p>Making things even more difficult for Arizona is that they’ll have to do so without their starting quarterback, Carson Palmer. Palmer suffered a season-ending arm injury in Week 10 and will be replaced by backup Drew Stanton.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Stanton, he has some experience in this role. He started six games for the Cardinals back in 2014 when Palmer was injured. In those appearances, Stanton completed 60 percent of his passes for 1,422 yards and seven touchdowns against just five interceptions.</p>
<p>If the Cardinals are going to succeed with Stanton at the helm, they’ll need continued production from running back Adrian Peterson. The veteran rusher is coming off one of his best seasons in years, posting over 1,000 yards from scrimmage.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Cardinals will need their defense to step up. Led by linebacker Chandler Jones and cornerback Patrick Peterson, the unit finished the season ranked sixth in points allowed per game.</p>
<p>Of course, even with all of these factors working in their favor, the Cardinals face long odds of making it to Super Bowl LIII. Vegas currently has them listed as 25-1 shots to win it all, behind six other teams in their conference.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean they can’t pull off an upset or two along the way. With a bit of luck and some inspired play from their key players, anything is possible for this underdog squad.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-Poised-to-Overcome-Spread-vs-Seahawks"><a href="#Cardinals-Poised-to-Overcome-Spread-vs-Seahawks" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Poised to Overcome Spread vs. Seahawks"></a>Cardinals Poised to Overcome Spread vs. Seahawks</h1><p>The Cardinals open their 2017 NFL playoff campaign as 6-point underdogs on the road against the Seahawks.</p>
<p> many handicappers and observers feel that the Cardinals don’t have a chance in this game. After watching the tape, however, I believe that Arizona can overcome the spread and pull off an upset win on Saturday.</p>
<p>To start, let’s take a look at how Carson Palmer and the Cardinals passing attack matches up against Seattle’s secondary. On one hand, you have Palmer, who is coming off of one of his best seasons to date. He completed nearly 67% of his passes while throwing for over 4,000 yards and 26 touchdowns. His top target, Larry Fitzgerald, continued to impress at age 34, hauling in 107 receptions for 1,023 yards and 6 touchdowns.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have Seattle’s secondary, which was ranked 10th in the league this season in terms of passing yards allowed per game (225.8). However, they did give up an alarming amount of big plays through the air (33 catches of 20+ yards), which could be exploited by Fitzgerald &amp; Co. In addition, Seattle’s cornerback duo of Richard Sherman and Shaquill Griffin are both very talented but also inexperienced. This could prove to be a mismatch for Palmer and his receiving corps.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at Arizona’s rushing attack vs. Seattle’s run defense. The Cardinals finished the season ranked 11th in the league in rushing yards per game (117.3) while averaging 4.3 yards per carry as a team. The Seahawks were slightly better against the run this season, ranking 8th in terms of rushing yards allowed per game (101.8) while also averaging 4.3 yards per carry allowed themselves.</p>
<p>However, there are two key factors that work in Arizona’s favor here: 1) Seattle was actually much worse against teams with mobile quarterbacks (ranked 26th) than they were against conventional quarterbacks (ranked 3rd); and 2) David Johnson is one of the most versatile running backs in all of football. Not only does he have breakaway speed but he’s also an excellent receiver out of the backfield, which could cause matchup problems for Seattle’s linebackers and safeties.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s take a look at how each team’s respective defenses stack up against each other. The Cardinals finished the season ranked 3rd in terms of total defensive DVOA while also ranking 5th in terms of passing defensive DVOA and 14th in terms of run defensive DVOA . The Seahawks finished the season ranked 7th in terms of total defensive DVOA while also ranking 9th in terms of passing defensive DVOA and 13th in terms of run defensive DVOA . So both defenses are pretty evenly matched overall.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that Palmer will have a big day against Seattle’s secondary, Johnson will find success running against Seattle’s defense, and Arizona’s defense will keep Russell Wilson &amp; Co. relatively under control throughout the game - leading to an upset victory for the Cardinals as 6-point underdogs on the road</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-Eyeing-Upset-of-Seahawks-as-Underdogs"><a href="#Cardinals-Eyeing-Upset-of-Seahawks-as-Underdogs" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Eyeing Upset of Seahawks as Underdogs"></a>Cardinals Eyeing Upset of Seahawks as Underdogs</h1><p>The Seattle Seahawks are entering Week 10 as nine-point favorites against the Arizona Cardinals, but the Cardinals believe they can pull off the upset.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of pride, and we don’t want to be known as a team that can only beat bad teams,” quarterback Carson Palmer said. “We want to beat the best teams and be in the playoffs. This is a big game for us. We know they’re a good team, but we feel like we can compete with them.”</p>
<p>Seattle has been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL this season, leading the league with an 8-1 record. The Cardinals, on the other hand, are just 4-5 and have lost their last two games.</p>
<p>But Palmer is confident that his team can pull off the upset on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Our offense is clicking right now, our defense is playing well and we have guys who can make plays,” Palmer said. “We just need to go out there and execute our game plan. We know it won’t be easy, but we believe we can win this game.”</p>
