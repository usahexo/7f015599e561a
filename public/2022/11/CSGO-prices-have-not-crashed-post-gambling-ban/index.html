        <h1 id="CSGO-prices-have-not-crashed-post-gambling-ban"><a href="#CSGO-prices-have-not-crashed-post-gambling-ban" class="headerlink" title="CSGO prices have not crashed post gambling ban"></a>CSGO prices have not crashed post gambling ban</h1><p>Since the implementation of the CSGO gambling ban in early July, there have been many speculations on the future of CSGO prices. Many people were predicting that the prices of skins would crash as a result of this ban, but this has not been the case. In fact, the average prices of most skins have remained relatively stable post-ban.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, many players have simply shifted to other games to gamble on, such as Dota 2 and Rocket League. This means that there is still a demand for CSGO skins, even if it is not from gambling enthusiasts. Secondly, veteran players who have accumulated large stockpiles of skins are reluctant to sell them at reduced prices, knowing that they can still make a profit down the line.</p>
<p>This stability in prices is good news for both Valve and skin traders. For Valve, it means that they can continue to make money from skin sales without having to worry about the negative consequences of gambling. And for traders, it means that they can continue to make profits by buying and selling skins at current prices. So if you’re looking to buy or sell CSGO skins, now is a good time to do so!</p>
<h1 id="CSGO-gambling-sites-still-operational-after-Valve-crackdown"><a href="#CSGO-gambling-sites-still-operational-after-Valve-crackdown" class="headerlink" title="CSGO gambling sites still operational after Valve crackdown"></a>CSGO gambling sites still operational after Valve crackdown</h1><p>The popular online game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CSGO, has been at the center of a gambling controversy in recent months. Valve, the company that created and operates CSGO, has been cracking down on gambling websites that use the game’s skins as currency.</p>
<p>Skins are virtual items that players can earn by playing CSGO matches or by opening crates that they receive as rewards. Skins can also be bought from other players through the Steam marketplace. Skins can be turned into coins on gambling websites, which are then used to bet on the outcome of professional CSGO games.</p>
<p>Gambling with skins became popular in CSGO because Valve does not allow players to trade skins for real-world money. This means that gambling sites were the only way for players to convert their skins into cash.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Valve sent letters to 23 different gambling websites telling them to cease operations immediately or face legal action. Some of these websites responded by shutting down, while others chose to continue operations without using Valve’s software.</p>
<p>CSGO gambling is not illegal in most countries, but it is against Valve’s terms of service to use its software for gambling purposes. The company claims that it is only trying to protect its players and stop them from being scammed out of their skins.</p>
<p>Despite Valve’s crackdown, many of the largest and most popular CSGO gambling sites are still operational. One site, CSGOBig, has a Alexa ranking of 1,418, which puts it in the top 3% of all websites worldwide.</p>
<p>CSGOBig is one of the sites that decided to continue operations without using Valve’s software. The website allows players to bet on professional CSGO games using coins that they have earned by playing the game or by converting their skins into coins.</p>
<p>Some people have accused CSGOBig of being a scam because it has allegedly failed to pay out winnings on multiple occasions. However, the site denies these allegations and says that it has always paid out its winners.</p>
<h1 id="CSGO-gambling-left-unaffected-by-Valve’s-recent-actions"><a href="#CSGO-gambling-left-unaffected-by-Valve’s-recent-actions" class="headerlink" title="CSGO gambling left unaffected by Valve’s recent actions"></a>CSGO gambling left unaffected by Valve’s recent actions</h1><p>Yesterday, Valve Corporation made a sweeping change to how their Steam platform operates. In a move that has surprised many in the gaming industry, Valve announced that they will no longer allow games that offer ‘skins’ as part of their in-game economies.</p>
<p>This change is set to affect a great number of popular games on Steam, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO), Dota 2, and Team Fortress 2. However, CSGO gambling websites - which allow players to win or lose skins in exchange for real money - have been left unaffected by Valve’s actions.</p>
<p>The news has caused much consternation within the gaming community, with some accusing Valve of hypocrisy. Gabe Newell and other company officials have previously spoken out against CSGO gambling, calling it a “vulnerability” in the game’s design. Newell went so far as to say that Valve would take action against such sites “soon”.</p>
<p>It is not clear why Valve has chosen to target only certain types of in-game microtransactions, while leaving CSGO gambling untouched. Some have speculated that the company is concerned about its liability for allowing gambling on its platform, while others have suggested that Valve may be seeking to profit from skin betting themselves.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for this unexpected change, it is clear that CSGO gambling will continue unaffected. This news will be welcomed by those who use such websites to gamble, as well as by the site owners who generate significant profits from them.</p>
<h1 id="CSGO-gambling-industry-booming-after-Valve’s-crackdown"><a href="#CSGO-gambling-industry-booming-after-Valve’s-crackdown" class="headerlink" title="CSGO gambling industry booming after Valve’s crackdown"></a>CSGO gambling industry booming after Valve’s crackdown</h1><p>The gambling industry surrounding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is booming again after Valve’s crackdown last year.</p>
<p>CSGO gambling is a process where players can bet on the outcome of a match using in-game items called skins. These skins can be traded and used as currency on websites like CSGO Lounge and Skin Up.</p>
<p>After Valve cracked down on these websites in July of 2016, the industry took a hit. Many of the top sites were shut down and the value of skins plummeted.</p>
<p>Now, though, the industry is thriving once again. CSGO Lounge has seen its user base triple in size over the past six months and Skin Up has seen an increase in traffic of over 700%.</p>
<p>The reason for this resurgence is likely due to two factors. First, many of the top websites have returned since Valve’s crackdown and are now operating legally. Second, the skin betting market has become more mainstream thanks to coverage from popular media outlets like ESPN and Kotaku.</p>
<p>This growth will likely continue in the years ahead as the industry becomes more mainstream and regulations are put in place. For now, though, CSGO gambling remains a largely unregulated Wild West</p>
<h1 id="Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive-prices-hold-steady-after-gambling-crackdown"><a href="#Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive-prices-hold-steady-after-gambling-crackdown" class="headerlink" title="Counter-Strike: Global Offensive prices hold steady after gambling crackdown"></a>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive prices hold steady after gambling crackdown</h1><p>After Valve’s crackdown on CS:GO gambling, the game’s prices have held steady.</p>
<p>The average price of a CS:GO skin on the Steam marketplace has not changed since the start of July, according to data from PriceHistory.gg.</p>
<p>This is a sharp contrast to the fluctuations in prices seen prior to the gambling crackdown, which often saw prices rise and fall by hundreds of dollars in just a few days.</p>
<p>Prior to Valve’s announcement in July, some of the most expensive skins on the Steam marketplace were those associated with CS:GO gambling. For instance, the Dragon Lore skin was worth $2,000 before Valve’s announcement.</p>
<p>However, since Valve’s announcement, the Dragon Lore skin has only been sold for around $1,600. This suggests that many players are holding off on selling their skins until the gambling issue is resolved.</p>
